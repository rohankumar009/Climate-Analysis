# RainFall-Analysis

## Project Overview

The project aims to visualize rainfall data using Java and JavaFX. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing over 9000 lines of information collected during a specific month, August. The project's primary objectives are to section the data into multiple bins, create graphical representations based on the probability distribution at various points, and calculate the cumulative probability of the rainfall data.

### Key Features and Components:

Data Collection and Parsing: The project begins by retrieving the rainfall data from the CSV file and parsing it in Java to extract the necessary information.

Data Segmentation: The rainfall data is divided into multiple bins or categories, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis. This segmentation facilitates a better understanding of rainfall patterns based on various intensity levels.

Probability Distribution Graphs: Using JavaFX, the project generates graphical representations of the rainfall data based on probability distributions. These graphs provide visual insights into the likelihood of specific rainfall values occurring within the given dataset.

Cumulative Probability Calculation: The project also involves calculating the cumulative probability of the rainfall data. This metric helps determine the likelihood of observing a certain amount of rainfall or less during the specified period.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface is implemented using JavaFX, enabling users to interact with the data visualizations, adjust parameters, and explore rainfall patterns effectively.
